    "\n",
    "> __a)__ Functional programming involves splitting a problem into smaller functions that can be parrallelized on different nodes .These nodes do not communicate with each other, function in silos and avoid having a global state or variable. This type of programming is done with expressions. Hadoop mapreduce consist of high order functions like map and reduce that work using this paradigm. They accept the other function as an argument.Map phase generally runs in parallel on different chunks of data  distributed across different resources and emits an output that goes to reduce phase which aggregates the inetermidiate output of mappers. Between the output and input of these functions there is no global state or variable, that is the entire framework is stateless.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Hadoop shuffle is the process by which hadoop streaming performs sorting within each partition and transfers each partition of the map outputs to specific reducers so that all the same keys go to same reducer. This process happens after the mapper has produced the output and before reducer phase starts. This is the most expensive part of the framework.  It is costly because it performs merge sort on the output of mappers once all mappers have completed their task and gathers all the same keys together. This operation is of nlogn where n is the number of records that go to reducer phase. We can mitigate this cost by reducing number of records to reducer phase by using local aggregations and combiners on the mapper output.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Input and output of combiner script should be same format because it requires to take the output of mapper and just aggregate it to reduce the number of records that are sent to shuffle process. It does not need to perform any other calculation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ User can control what computation or program can run in mapper phase in parallel but cannot control number of mappers in hadoop streaming jobs. It depends on how many blocks the data is span across.The number of mappers depends on the data block size for each node and size of data to be processed. If data is 640MB file and data block size is 128 MB then hadoop will run 5 mappers per mapReduce job.However, user can specifify number of reduce tasks in hadoop streaming job, hence number of reducers running in parallel can be controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Memory is getting cheaper and network is becoming faster.At the same time, there are several devices and products that is making dat bigger and bigger. This prompted creation of parallel computation framwords as it has become cheaper and efficient to process data on distributed network and processes."

    "> __a)__ Whenever a hadoop streaming job gets executed, Hadoop Framework initiates Counters to keep track of job statistics like the number of bytes read, the number of rows read, the number of rows written etc after each task.This gives information to users regarding how much of data is being processed and produced by each task, which is specially useful to monitor the smount of work each reducer node is doing. It is also helful to monitor the effectiveness of comniners in reducing input to shuffle. It also gives info to confirm that the expected amount of input was processed and expected output amount of output was produced.There are some built-in Counters in Hadoop for every job. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1) MapReduce Task Counters: collects tasks information over the course of their execution and then aggregate results over all the tasks.\n",
    "    2) File System Counter: It tracks the number of bytes read by the file system and a number of bytes written.\n",
    "    3) Job Counter: Jobtracker (or application master in YARN) maintain Job Counters, so they don’t need to be sent across the network.\n",
    "Custom Counters can be used to have track of any kind of statistics about the records written as logic in Mapper and Reducers.It is useful in the debugging process to find the number of Bad Records.Custom counters are a slight departure from statelessness, however in this case the framework manages so that you can increment them from any node without causing a race condition.\n",
    "To use a custom counter we can write an appropriately formatted line to the standard error stream. For example the following line would increment a counter called 'counter-name' in group 'MyWordCounters' by 10:\n",
    "        sys.stderr.write(\"reporter:counter:MyWordCounters,counter-name,10\\n\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ For complex operation,we may need to sort not just by the key but also by value.This is called a 'secondary sort'. For this, we may need to have composite key that constitute of 2 or more fields in the data and specified in hadoop streaming job to be used for sorting instead of default sorting.We can tell Hadoop that we want to make comparisons (for sorting) based on the fields in this composite keyas well as the order and the data type to consider for sorting. \n",
    "User can also define custom partitioning in mapreduce. User can include the keys of the custom partitioning in the composite key and can tell Hadoop to use that part of composite key to sort partitions. In this way, user can achieve not only sorted output within custom partition but also have the partitions in an order as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The order inversion is design pattern that is useful when we need reducers to reduce to ratio/relative frequencies or calculations of the nature that requires to get metrics based on total number of records and not just records within a key. For such calculations, we will need the output of mapper's computation in the beginning of reduce task before reducers begins to calculate. This design exploits the sorting phase of MapReduce to push data needed for calculations to the reducer ahead of the data that will be manipulated.For example, with understanding of hadoop's default sorting, the total records can be emitted by mapper as an additional key with a special character (lets say as '*total'). Since hadoop will always sort special character at the top, the output to reducers will have this additional key in the beginning itself.\n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb).

    "> __a)__ In Partial Sort, the reducer output will partition file/s and each key value in partition file will be sorted based on the default key. In unordered sort, the sorting within partition files based upon a specified key. Total sort will not only have keys within each partition file sorted in specified way but will also have partition files in an order.\n",
    "Total order sort allows user to define ordering of partitions Unordered sort where partition files will need to be re-stacked to generate a total ordering. We will need small post-processing step that is required to sort the partition files after the map-reduce job finishes. This is not needed in Total order sort since it allows user to define ordering of partitions in the hadoop streaming job itself. \n",
    "In unordered sort, since we dont know which partition file has top or bottom results,for large dataset it is inefficient. For big data it is important information which can avoid going through entire data. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Mapping phase is used to define custom partitioning, instead of hadoop's default partitioning. However, we need to reverse engineer hadoop hash function to define partition key so that we can create partition keys in order for human reading rather than hadoop's inbuilt ordering of characters. This key needs to be specified in hadoop streaming job and we need to tell hadoop to use custom partitioning so that shuffle phase of mapreduce job can pick this key to send sorted order of partition files to reducers. If we dont specify in hadoop streaming job, hadoop will create partitions and sort with its default behaviour. That may cause imbalance in data that are sent to reducers and there may be situation where one reducer may process larger part of data than other reducers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ For Custom sorting, we need to  add three parameters to Hadoop Streaming command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -D stream.num.map.output.key.fields=n : tells Hadoop to treat first n (tab separated) fields as a composite key.\n",

    "        -D mapreduce.partition.keycomparator.options=\"-ki,i -kn,n \": Tells Hadoop to perform a sort on the ith field in the composite key and then break ties by sorting on the nth field in the composite key. \n",
    "\n",
    "    For custom partitioning, Hadoop provides a way to partition the data across reducers in a user-defined way. This is done telling Hadoop to use all or part of the composite key as a partitioning key. All lines with the same partition key are guaranteed to be processed by the same reducer. To use custom partitioning, there are 2 more parameters we need to add to our Hadoop Streaming Command:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -D mapreduce.partition.keypartitioner.options=\"-k1,1\": tells Hadoop that we want to use the first key field as a partition key. We can set any key in mapper output to be set as partition key\n",

    "        -partitioner org.apache.hadoop.mapred.lib.KeyFieldBasedPartitioner: tells Hadoop that we want to partition the data in a custom way.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ By default, Hadoop computes the partition index for keys produced by mappers. When we configure Hadoop Streaming to use KeyBasedPartitioner, Hadoop reads in the partition key as a string. The partition key is then hashed (as string) and hadoop uses this hashkey for sorting which is different from sorting by string.In order to preserve partition key ordering, we need to have inverse hashCode function  that takes as input the desired partition index and total number of partitions, and returns the partition key.\n",

    "* __e) code:__ A more efficient alternative to '`grep`-ing' for the top 10 words in each class would be to use the Hadoop framework to separate records from each class into its own partition so that we can just read the top lines in each. Rewrite your job from ` part d` to specify 2 reduce tasks and to tell Hadoop to partition based on the second field (which indicates spam/ham in our data). Your code should maintain the secondary sort -- that is each partition should list words from most to least frequent."

    "# Question 7: Naive Bayes Inference.\n",
    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ run the provided cells to create the example files and load them in to HDFS. Then take a closer look at __`NBmodel.txt`__. This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Documents 6 and 8 in the test set include a word that did not appear in the training corpus (and as a result does not appear in the model). What should we do at inference time when we need a class conditional probability for this word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not. From a scability perspective when would this kind of memory use be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/classify_mapper.py`__. Read the docstring carefully to understand how this script should work and the format it should return. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your script works as expected then write a Hadoop streaming job to classify the Chinese example test set. [`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "### Q7 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ The key is word and the values are spam count, ham count, likelihood of each term being in spam class,likelihood of each term being in ham class \n",
    " The record which is different is the key Classpriors. the first 2 values of class prior key are the count of words in spam and ham. These values will be helpful in debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ In Naive Bayes, a problem arises when the size of the vocabulary gets very big.Since $\\hat{P}(t_{k} | c)$ is between 0 and 1,  when we start multiplying them together for each word, the overall product starts approaching zero which often cannot be represented in a double or long double. This issue caused computational issue in almost every language which uses a standard floating-point data type with a fixed number of bits . The calculated probablity will eventuallyrun out of precision with extremely tiny numbers.Work-around for this situation is to represent probabilities as log probabilities instead. This is the problem of underflow. For unsmoothened model, for new or unseen word, the probablity is going to be 0. Log transformation of 0 will lead to error.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ We can ignore it, or add this word to both classes and then take log.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Technically, it is a slight departure from statelessness, however,since we have loaded it on every node and every node has its own copy, the nodes can still continue to work in silos and without communicating to each other. In other words, this is okay since there is no issue of race conditions.From scalability perpective, it is okay as long as such files are small in size since keeping them in memory is going to have fast access. But when the files become large, it is going to start takling up resources and may have to be spilled to disk, which are slower to access. It will be unwise to keep them in memory in such case.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Complete the coding portion of this question before answering 'f'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ In case when one document may not fit in one mapper, our algorithm design should produce partial probablities for the documents from each mapper. we will need to have reducer for each document to gather and reduce these partial probalities to total probabality of document. mMppers can still calculate partial probabalities. The key will be doc id but one doc id key can be on multiple mappers.The values will be true class, partial logspam and partial logham. Reducers will have to aggregate the partial log probablities , calculate pred class and emit it.\n"

    "# Question 8: Naive Bayes Training.\n",
    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace smoothing (where the smoothing parameter $k=1$) makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "> __ c)__ The extra piece of info missing is vocabulary of the corpus, that is count of unique words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ d)__ The first option is non ideal for regular classification work where the input data is changing frequently, like reddit feed etc,  because in that case our vocab size has to be calculated everytime we run the job. In such case, its better top have this incorporated in the hadoop mapreduce job. \n",
    "On the other hand, the 2nd option will be non ideal when our feed is having more of a static vocabulary, such as weather forecast which generally has fixed/static vocabulary. Our job does not need to recalculate vocabulary everytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ e)__ I chose the 2nd option and implemented two mapreduce job because we are training model on email feed, which in practice, will have changing vocabulary size. \n",
    "    a. First mapreduce job is doing word partial counts and document partial counts in mapper and reducing/aggregating the counts in reducer with custom partitioning. The output of this job will have unique words along with aggregated document count and word count for each class.\n",
    "    b. Second mapreduce is calculating vocabulary partial count using local aggregator in mapper and likelihood calculation is done in reducer. We are reusing the partition key from first job. We should keep the number of reducers for both jobs same for this reason. It is possible to decouple it by an independing custom partitioning in 2nd job. \n",
    "   Also, since 2nd mapreduce takes in aggregated result from 1st mapreduce, this strategy is more efficient than passing through entire data in both jobs. \n",

    "Fantastic work. We're finally ready to perform Spam Classification on the Enron Corpus. In this question you'll run the analysis you've developed, report its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ Compare the performance of your two models. What do you notice about the unsmoothed model's predictions? Can you guess why this is happening? Which evaluation measure do you think is most relevant in our use case? [`NOTE:` _Feel free to answer using your common sense but if you want more information on evaluating the classification task checkout_ [this blogpost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\n",

    "### Q9 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __d)__  In the unsmoothed model performance, we notice a lot of false negatives and low acuracy. This is because there are unseen words which due to no smoothing, are making the likelihood 0 for the document to be classified, when it is actually belonging to the class.\n",
    "While accuracy provides info about model's performance, it is not enough. We also need to consider precision since an email being categorized as spam when it is not is a very costly error. Recall also needs to be considered but it is not as important as precision. That is why fscore is not the appropriate metric to measure in this case because it gives equal weightage to precision and recall.\n",

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",

    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
